what was the simplest way to export some document in erpnext as fixtures in hooks, i mean the structure 
ChatGPT said:
The simplest and cleanest way to export any DocType documents as fixtures in ERPNext/Frappe is to define them inside the hooks.py file using the standard fixtures structure.

Here is the minimal, correct, working structure:

✅ 1. Easiest Fixture Structure (simple filter)
If you want to export specific documents based on a filter:

fixtures = [
    {
        "doctype": "Custom Field",
        "filters": {
            "name": ["like", "my_custom_field_%"]
        }
    }
]
This will export all Custom Field rows where name starts with my_custom_field_.

✅ 2. Export a Single Document By Name
fixtures = [
    {
        "doctype": "Print Format",
        "filters": {
            "name": ["=", "My Custom Print Format"]
        }
    }
]
✅ 3. Export Multiple DocTypes
fixtures = [
    {"doctype": "Custom Field"},
    {"doctype": "Property Setter"},
    {"doctype": "Client Script"},
    {"doctype": "Server Script"}
]
⚠️ This exports all documents of the listed DocTypes — use filters if you want only your app’s data.

✅ 4. Export Only Your App's Custom Fields
ERPNext best practice: filter by module name:

fixtures = [
    {
        "doctype": "Custom Field",
        "filters": {
            "module": ["=", "Pharmacy Management"]
        }
    },
    {
        "doctype": "Property Setter",
        "filters": {
            "module": ["=", "Pharmacy Management"]
        }
    }
]
✅ 5. Export Documents From Your Own Custom DocTypes
Example: export all rows in your custom DocType:

fixtures = [
    {
        "doctype": "Agency",
        "filters": {}
    }
]
⚠️ Use with care — exporting transactional data is usually not recommended unless it’s setup data only.

📌 Location Where Fixtures Will Be Generated
When you run:

bench export-fixtures
Data is exported to:

my_app/fixtures/
Each file is named like:

custom_field.json
server_script.json
agency.json
⭐ Recommended Pattern (Cleanest, Safe, Used by ERPNext Apps)
fixtures = [
    {
        "doctype": "Custom Field",
        "filters": {"module": ["=", "My App Name"]}
    },
    {
        "doctype": "Property Setter",
        "filters": {"module": ["=", "My App Name"]}
    },
    {
        "doctype": "Client Script",
        "filters": {"module": ["=", "My App Name"]}
    },
    {
        "doctype": "Server Script",
        "filters": {"module": ["=", "My App Name"]}
    }
]
Always filter by module → avoids conflicts and prevents pulling unrelated data.

👍 Summary (Simple Template)
Here is the simplest, copy-paste ready structure:

fixtures = [
    {
        "doctype": "Custom Field",
        "filters": {
            "module": ["=", "My App"]
        }
    }
]
This is the cleanest, safe, ERPNext-recommended format.

If you want, tell me your App name and which DocTypes you want exported, and I can prepare the exact fixtures = [...] block for you.

You said:
there is name in also , correct ? 
ChatGPT said:
Yes — 100% correct.
You can also filter by name inside fixtures. It is fully supported and commonly used.

Here is the correct structure when using name:

✅ Fixture with name Filter (Correct & Supported)
✔ Example: export ONE document by exact name:
fixtures = [
    {
        "doctype": "Custom Field",
        "filters": {
            "name": ["=", "my_custom_field_name"]
        }
    }
]
✅ Export multiple specific documents by name
fixtures = [
    {
        "doctype": "Custom Field",
        "filters": {
            "name": ["in", ["cf_item_code", "cf_customer_group", "cf_territory"]]
        }
    }
]
✅ Export using name pattern (LIKE)
fixtures = [
    {
        "doctype": "Custom Field",
        "filters": {
            "name": ["like", "agency_%"]
        }
    }
]
🧠 Important Notes About name Filter
✔ Works for all DocTypes
✔ name is always the document's unique ID
✔ Use = for single, in for multiple, like for patterns
✔ Works perfectly with bench export-fixtures
✔ Output files will contain only those specific documents

⭐ Combine name + module (best practice)
If you want to limit fixtures to only your app's data, do:

fixtures = [
    {
        "doctype": "Custom Field",
        "filters": {
            "module": ["=", "Pharmacy Management"],
            "name": ["like", "pharmacy_%"]
        }
    }
]
🎯 Final Confirmation
✔ Yes, name absolutely exists
✔ Yes, it is valid in fixtures
✔ Yes, it is the simplest way to export specific documents

If you want, tell me what DocType + names you want to export, and I will generate the cleanest fixture block for your app.
